    "**Ridge Regression** is a type of **linear regression** that is used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is similar to **ordinary least squares (OLS) regression**, but with an additional penalty term that shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero. This penalty term is known as the **L2 regularization** term, and it helps to reduce the variance of the regression coefficients, which can help to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, OLS regression does not include any penalty term, and it seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. OLS regression is often used when there are no issues with multicollinearity or overfitting.\n",

    "The assumptions of Ridge Regression are the same as those of linear regression, which include **linearity**, **constant variance**, and **independence**. However, as Ridge Regression does not provide confidence limits, the distribution of errors to be normal need not be assumed.\n",
    "1. Linearity: Ridge regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means that the coefficients associated with each independent variable are multiplied by their values and summed to predict the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors: Similar to OLS, ridge regression assumes that the errors or residuals are independent of each other. This assumption implies that there should be no systematic pattern or correlation among the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: Ridge regression assumes that the variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multicollinearity: Ridge regression is specifically designed to address the issue of multicollinearity. It assumes that multicollinearity, or high correlation among the independent variables, is present in the data. Ridge regression introduces a penalty term to mitigate multicollinearity and stabilize the model coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Normally Distributed Errors: While ridge regression is robust to violations of the normality assumption, like OLS, it assumes that the errors are roughly normally distributed. Deviations from normality may be less problematic in ridge regression compared to OLS, but it's still a helpful assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. No Perfect Multicollinearity: Ridge regression assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity in the data. Perfect multicollinearity occurs when one or more independent variables can be perfectly predicted from the others, leading to issues in estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. No Endogeneity: Ridge regression, like OLS, assumes that the independent variables are not correlated with the error term. In other words, there should be no endogeneity, where the independent variables are influenced by the unobserved factors."
