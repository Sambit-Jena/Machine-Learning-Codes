    "**GridSearchCV** is a process of performing **hyperparameter tuning** to determine the optimal values for a given model. The performance of a model significantly depends on the value of hyperparameters. However, there is no way to know in advance the best values for hyperparameters. Therefore, we need to try all possible values to know the optimal values. Doing this manually could take a considerable amount of time and resources. Hence, we use GridSearchCV to automate the tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV is a function that comes in Scikit-learn’s (or SK-learn) \"model_selection\" package. This function helps to loop through predefined hyperparameters and fit your estimator (model) on your training set. We pass predefined values for hyperparameters to the GridSearchCV function by defining a dictionary in which we mention a particular hyperparameter along with the values it can take. GridSearchCV tries all the combinations of the values passed in the dictionary and evaluates the model for each combination using the Cross-Validation method. After using this function, we get accuracy/loss for every combination of hyperparameters, and we can choose the one with the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use GridSearchCV, we need to have Scikit-learn library installed on our computer. We can use GridSearchCV by passing various arguments such as estimator, param_grid, scoring, n_jobs, cv, etc., to the function ¹. We can find more information about these arguments in the original documentation."
