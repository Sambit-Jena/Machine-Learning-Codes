    "Unsupervised learning can be effectively used in anomaly detection to identify unusual or unexpected patterns in data without the need for labeled examples of anomalies. Anomalies are instances that deviate significantly from the normal behavior of the dataset. Here's how unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to anomaly detection:\n",
