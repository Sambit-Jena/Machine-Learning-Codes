    "R-squared is a statistical measure that evaluates the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively. R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 â€“ 100% scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate R-squared, we first need to calculate the total sum of squares (TSS), which is the sum of the squared differences between each observed dependent variable and the mean of all dependent variables. Then, we calculate the residual sum of squares (RSS), which is the sum of the squared differences between each observed dependent variable and its predicted value. Finally, we calculate R-squared as 1 - (RSS/TSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit. A value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variation in the response variable around its mean, while a value of 1 indicates that the model explains all of it. However, it is important to note that R-squared has some limitations. For example, it does not indicate whether a regression model is adequate or not, nor does it indicate whether a significant relationship exists between independent and dependent variables. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other statistical measures to evaluate a regression model's performance."

    "The standard R-squared value measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the model.
