    "**Web hosting** is a service that involves storing site files on a server. In the traditional sense, there are two types of web hosting: virtual or dedicated. In the first case, the company hosting the site buys a certain amount of space on the server. As a rule, server resources are used simultaneously by several web resources. The second option assumes that the site owner pays for full control over one or more servers. This means that we do not need to share resources with other sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud hosting** represents storage located in virtual space. Instead of paying for a fixed space on the server, we need to pay for the resources used now. Cloud hosting is flexible in terms of resource allocation and is recommended for websites that handle large amounts of traffic. "

    "\n",
    "5. **Support**: Look for a cloud provider that offers 24/7 support and has a good reputation for customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Flexibility**: Choose a cloud provider that offers flexibility in terms of resource allocation and allows us to customize our infrastructure to meet our specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Integration**: Ensure that the cloud provider can integrate with our existing systems and tools.\n",
