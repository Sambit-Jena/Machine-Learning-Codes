    "1. **Linearity**: There should be a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This can be checked by creating a scatter plot of the data and visually inspecting whether the points form a straight line.\n",

    "2. **Independence**: The residuals (the difference between the observed values and the predicted values) should be independent of each other. This means that there should be no correlation between consecutive residuals in time series data.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are the two parameters that define the line of best fit. The **slope** represents the change in the dependent variable (y) for a one-unit increase in the independent variable (x). In other words, it tells us how much y changes for every unit increase in x. The **intercept** represents the value of y when x is equal to zero. It is the point where the line of best fit intersects with the y-axis.\n",

    "For example, let's consider a simple linear regression model to predict a student's test score (y) based on the number of hours they studied (x). The equation of the line can be written as y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Suppose we find that m = 5 and b = 50. This means that for every additional hour of studying, we can expect a student's test score to increase by 5 points. Additionally, if a student did not study at all (x = 0), we would expect their test score to be 50.\n",
