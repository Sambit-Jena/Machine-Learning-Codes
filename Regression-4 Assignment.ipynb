    "Lasso Regression is a popular technique used in statistical modeling and machine learning to estimate the relationships between variables and make predictions. It is also known as L1 regularization. The primary goal of Lasso regression is to find a balance between model simplicity and accuracy. It achieves this by adding a penalty term to the traditional linear regression model, which encourages sparse solutions where some coefficients are forced to be exactly zero. This feature makes Lasso particularly useful for feature selection, as it can automatically identify and discard irrelevant or redundant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques such as Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and Least Squares Regression in the way it handles the coefficients of the independent variables. While Ridge Regression adds a penalty term based on the square of the coefficients (L2 regularization), Lasso Regression adds a penalty term based on the absolute value of the coefficients (L1 regularization). This difference leads to different solutions for the same problem."

    "The primary advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to identify and prioritize the most relevant features by driving some regression coefficients to zero. This promotes sparsity in the model and enables automatic feature selection, which is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. By removing irrelevant or redundant variables, Lasso Regression can help improve the accuracy of the model while reducing its complexity, making it more interpretable and minimizing the risk of overfitting."

A higher value of λ can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance by reducing the complexity of the model.

    "Lasso Regression does not handle multicollinearity well. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more highly correlated predictor variables make it difficult to determine their individual contributions to the model. In such cases, Lasso Regression might not be the best choice. However, there are ways to deal with multicollinearity in Lasso Regression. One way is to use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of the input features before applying Lasso Regression. Another way is to use **Elastic Net Regression**, which is a combination of Ridge and Lasso Regression. Elastic Net Regression can handle multicollinearity better than Lasso Regression by shrinking some coefficients and setting others to zero."
