    "Plotting the model's training and validation (or test) performance over epochs or iterations can reveal overfitting and underfitting. In the case of overfitting, we'll see a large gap between the training and validation/test performance as training progresses. For underfitting, both curves will converge at a low performance level.\n",

If the model performs well on training data but poorly on validation/test data across all folds, it might be overfitting. If it performs poorly on both training and validation/test data, it might be underfitting.\n",

    "* 4. Learning Curves:\n",
    "Plotting a learning curve that shows training and validation/test performance as a function of training data size can help identify overfitting and underfitting. In overfitting, the training performance is high, but the validation/test performance stagnates or worsens as data increases. In underfitting, both performances remain consistently low.\n",

    "* 6. Regularization Parameter Tuning:\n",
    "In models with regularization, adjusting the regularization strength can help mitigate overfitting. If increasing regularization improves validation/test performance, overfitting might have been present.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 7. Ensemble Methods:\n",
    "Ensemble methods like bagging and boosting can help identify overfitting. If combining predictions from multiple models improves overall performance, it suggests that individual models were overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 8. Bias-Variance Analysis:\n",
